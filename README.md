Flash cards are an incredibly useful tool to help you remember everything. You should use them whether you are learning to code, preparing for an exam, or even doing public speaking. You can write facts and details on cards and use them as hints. Or with double-sided cards, you can write a question on one side and an answer on the other, and you have a ready-made pop quiz to test yourself at any time. But you don't need to have a real set of cards and a pen; Your phone can do the job just as well.
